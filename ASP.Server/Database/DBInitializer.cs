Shortly after the discovery, he announced\nthat \"the bright stars [the moons of Jupiterl offered themselves in the heavens\" to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II's enthronement. He\nsaid that the number of the moons-four-harmonized with the number of\nthe Medicis (Cosimo 11 had three brothers) and that the moons orbited\nJupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty's founder.\nMore than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected\nthe ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to\nthe Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representingJupiter sitting\non a cloud with the four stars circling about hirn, and presented this to\nCosimo 11 as a symbol of his link to the stars.\nIn 1610 Cosimo 11 made Galileo his official court philosopher and\nmathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a lifetime. The days of begging for patronage were over.\nInterpretation\nIn one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he had in\nyears of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to appear more\nbrilliant than other people.\nThey do not care about science or empirical truth or the latest invention; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the Medicis\ninfinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces than he had\nby making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget or discovery.\nScientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage. They\ntoo must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their great intellectual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he were only there to\nsupply the funds-an ugly, ignoble job. The producer of a great work\nwants to feel he is more than just the provider of the financing. He wants to\nappear creative and powerful, and also more important than the work produced in his name. Instead of insecurity you must give hirn glory. Galileo\ndid not challenge the intellectu� authority of the Medicis with his discovery, or make them feel inferior in any way; by literally aligning them with\nthe stars, he made them shine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did\nnot outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others.\nKEYS TO POWER\nEveryone has insecurities. W hen you show yourself in the world and display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentrnent, envy, and\nother manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend\nyour life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you,\nhowever, you must take a different approach: W hen it comes to power,\noutshining the master is perhaps the worst mi stake of all.\nDo not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the\ndays of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life\nare like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and \nsuperior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a deadly\nbut common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting\nYOUf gifts and talents, you are winning the master's affection. He may feign\nappreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone\nless intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced\nthe sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will\nnot admit the truth, but will find an excuse to rid hirnself of YOUf presence.\nThis Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can inadvertently outshine a master simply by being YOUfself. There are masters\nwho are more insecure than others, monstrously insecUfe; you may naturally outshine them by YOUf charm and grace.\nNo one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of\nFaenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated\nhis subjects with his generosity and open spirit.\nIn the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. W hen the city\nsurrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who,\nhowever, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its fortress, executed none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the\ntime, to remain with his court, in complete freedom.\nA few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a\nRoman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River\nTiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with\nso me sort of trumped-up charge of treason and conspiracy, but the real\nproblem was that he was notoriously vain and insecure. The young man\nwas outshining hirn without even trying. Given Manfredi's natural talents,\nthe prince's mere presence made Borgia seem less attractive and charismatic. The lesson is simple: If you cannot help being charming and superior, you must leam to avoid such monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a\nway to mute your good qualities when in the company of a Cesare Borgia.\nSecond, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do\nanything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell\nout of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In\nlate-sixteenth-century Japan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man\ncalled Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had become an obsession with the nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi's most\ntrusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored\nthroughout Japan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had hirn arrested and sentenced\nto death. Rikyu took his own life, instead. The cause for his sudden change\nof fortune was discovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and\nlater court favorite, had had a wooden statue made of hirnself wearing sandals (a sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in\nthe most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the royalty who often would pass by. To Hideyoshi this signified that Rikyu had\nno sense of limits. Presuming that he had the same rights as those of the\nhighest nobility, he had forgotten that his position depended on the emperor, and had co me to believe that he had earned it on his own" };

Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude from a\nfriend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove grateful.\nThe problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably limit\nyour power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help you; and\nin the end, skill and competence are far more important than friendly feelings. (Michael III had a man right under his no se who would have steered\nhirn right and kept hirn alive: That man was Bardas.)\nAll working situations require a kind of distance between people. You\nare trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false) only obscures that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge who is best\nable to further your interests in all situations. Keep friends for friendship,\nbut work with the skilIed and competent.\nYour enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that you\nmust learn to exploit. When Talleyrand, Napoleon's foreign minister, decided in 1807 that his boss was leading France to ruin, and the time had\ncome to turn against hirn, he understood the dangers of conspiring against\nthe emperor; he needed a partner, a confederate--what friend could he\ntrust in such a project? He chose Joseph Fouche, head of the secret police,\nhis most hated enemy, a man who had even tried to have hirn assassinated.\nHe knew that their former hatred would create an opportunity for an emotional reconciliation. He knew that Fouche would expect nothing from\nhirn, and in fact would work to prove that he was worthy of Talleyrand's\nchoice; a person who has something to prove will move mountains for you.\nFinally, he knew that his relationship with Fouche would be based on mutual self-interest, and would not be contaminated by personal feeling. The\nselection proved perfect; although the conspirators did not succeed in toppling Napoleon, the union of such powerful but unlikely partners generated much interest in the cause; opposition to the emperor slowly began to\nspread. And from then on, Talleyrand and Fouche had a fruitful working\nrelationship. Whenever you can, bury the hatchet with an enemy, and\nmake a point of putting hirn in your service.\nAs Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend of\nhirn. In 1971, during the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger was the target of\nan unsuccessful kidnapping attempt, a conspiracy involving, among others,\nthe renowned antiwar activist priests the Berrigan brothers, four more\nCatholic priests, and four nuns. In private, without informing the Secret\nService or the Justice Department, Kissinger arranged a Saturday-morning\nmeeting with three of the alleged kidnappers. Explaining to his guests that\nhe would have most American soldiers out of Vietnam by mid-1972, he\ncompletely charmed them. They gave hirn some \"Kidnap Kissinger\" buttons and one of them remained a friend of his for years, visiting hirn on\nseveral occasions. This was not just a onetime ploy: Kissinger made a policy of working with those who disagreed with hirn. Colleagues commented\nthat he seemed to get along better with his enemies than with his friends.\nWithout enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels\nsharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert. It is sometimes better .then, to use enemies as enemies rather than transforming them into friends\nor allies.\nMao Tse-tung saw conflict as key in his approach to power. In 1937 the\nJapanese invaded China, interrupting the civil war between Mao's Communists and their enemy, the Nationalists.\nFearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist\nleaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using\nthe time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly\ndefeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the\nCommunists would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for\nseveral years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their struggle with the\nNationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the Japanese, in fact, would be\nthe perfect training for the Communists' ragtag army. Mao's plan was\nadopted, and it worked: By the time the Japanese finally retreated, the\nCommunists had gained the fighting experience that helped them defeat\nthe Nationalists.\nYears later, a Japanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his country's invasion of China. Mao interrupted, \"Should I not thank you instead?\" Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot\ngrow stronger.\nMao's strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First,\nbe certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a\nfight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the\nJapanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent enemies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even tuming a friend\ninto an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use\nsuch enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing\nit as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged China's disagreements with the Soviet U nion and the U nited States; without clear-cut\nenemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese\nCommunism meant. A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument\nfor your side than all the words you could possibly put together.\nNever let the presence of enemies upset or distress you-you are far\nbetter off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your\nreal enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to\nenhance his reputation as a surefooted fighter who can be relied upon in\ntimes of uncertainty.  " };

            Book book3 = new Book { Titre = "1984", Prix = 15, Auteur = GeorgeOrwell, Contenu = " Over several weeks, Ninon de Lenclos, the most infamous courtesan of\nseventeenth-century France, listened patiently as the Marquis de Sevigne\nexplained his struggles in pursuing a heautiful hut difficult young countess.\nNinon was sixty-two at the time, and more than experienced in matters of\nlove; the marquis was a lad of twenty-two, handsome, dashing, hut hopelessly inexperienced in romance. At first Ninon was amused to hear the\nmarquis talk ahout his mistakes, hut finally she had had enough. Unahle to\nhear ineptitude in any realm, least of all in seducing a woman, she decided\nto take the young man under her wing. First, hE\\ had to und erstand that this\nwas war, and that the heautiful countess was a Citadel to which he had to\nlay siege as carefully as any general. Every step had to he planned and executed with the utmost attention to detail and nuance.\nInstructing the marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach the\ncountess with a hit of distance, an air of nonchalance. The next time the\ntwo were alone together, she said, he would confide in the countess as\nwould a friend hut nota potential lover. This was to throw her off the scent.\nThe countess was no longer to take his interest in her for granted-perhaps\nhe was only interested in friendship.\nNinon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would he\ntime to make her jealous. At the next encounter, at a major fete in Paris, the\nmarquis would show up with a heautiful young woman at his side. This\nheautiful young woman had equally heautiful friends, so that wherever the\ncountess would now see the marquis, he would he surrounded hy the most\nstunning young women in Paris. Not only would the countess he seething\nwith jealousy, she would come to see the marquis as someone who was desired hy others. It was hard far Ninon to make the marquis understand, hut\nshe patiently explained that a woman who is interested in a man wants to\nsee that other women are interested in him, to�. Not only does that give\nhim instant value, it makes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from\ntheir clutches.\nOnce the countess was jealous hut intrigued, it would he time to heguile her. On Ninon's instructions, the marquis would fail to show up at affairs where the countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly, he would\nappear at salons he had never frequented hefore, hut that the countess at tended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would\npush her into the state of emotional confusion that is a prerequisite for successful seduction.\nThese moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon monitored the marquis's progress: Through her network of spies, she heard how\nthe countess would laugh a litde harder at his witticisms, listen more\nclosely to his stories. She heard that the countess was suddenly asking questions about hirn. Her friends told her that at social affairs the countess\nwould often look up at the marquis, following his steps. Ninon feJt certain\nthat the young woman was falling under his spell. It was a matter of weeks\nnow, maybe a month or two, but if all went smoothly, the citadel would\nfall.\nA few days later the marquis was at the countess's horne. They were\nalone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his own impulse, rather than following Ninon's instructions, he took the countess's\nhands and told her he was in love with her. The young woman seemed\nconfused, a reaction he did not expect. She became polite, then excused\nherself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his eyes, was not there to\nsay good-night to hirn. The next few times he visited he was told she was\nnot at horne. When she finally admitted hirn again, the two feIt awkward\nand uncomfortable with each other. The spell was broken.\nInterpretation\nNinon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The greatest writers, thinkers, and politicians of the time had been her lovers-men like La\nRochefoucauld, Moliere, and Richelieu. Seduction was a game to her, to be\npracticed with skill. As she got older, and her reputation grew, the most important families in France would send their sons to her to be instructed in\nmatters of love.\nNinon knew that men and women are very different, but when it\ncomes to seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense\nwhen they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feeling of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other person to detour you into a strange country. Everything in seduction,\nhowever, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce yOUf intentions or\nreveal them direcdy in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the\nscent. To surrender to YOUf guidance they must be appropriately confused.\nYou have to scramble your signals-appear interested in another man or\nwoman (the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign\nindifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite.\nImagine this story from the countess's perspective: After a few of the\nmarquis's moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of game,\nbut the game delighted her. She did not know where he was leading her,\nbut so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her\nwaiting for the next one--she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for\nsometimes any emotion is better than the boredom of security.

A few years later he\nbecame the Prussian premier. In this role he eventuaIly led his country and\na peace-loving king into a war against Austria, crushing the former empire\nand establishing a mighty German state, with Prussia at its head.\nInterpretation\nAt the time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several calculations.\nFirst, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not kept pace with\nother European armies, was unready for war-that Austria, in fact, might\nvery weIl win, a disastrous result for the future. Second, if the war were lost\nand Bismarck had supported it, his career would be gravely jeopardized.\nThe king and his conservative ministers wanted peace; Bismarck wanted\npower. The answer was to throw people off the scent by supporting a cause\nhe detested, saying things he would laugh at if said by another. A whole\ncountry was fooled. It was because of Bismarck's speech that the king made\nhirn a minister, a position from which he quickly rose to be prime minister,\nattaining the power to strengthen the Prussian military and accomplish\nwhat he had wanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unification of Germany under Prussia's leadership.\nBismarck was certainly one of the cleverest statesman who ever lived,\na master of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he was up to in\nthis case. Had he announced his real intentions, arguing that it was better\nto wait now and fight later, he would not have won the argument, since\nmost Prussians wanted war at that moment and mistakenly believed that\ntheir army was superior to the Austrians. Had he played up to the king,\nasking to be made a minister in exchange for supporting peace, he would\nnot have succeeded either: The king would have distrusted his ambition\nand doubted his sincerity.\nBy being completely insincere and sending misleading signals, however, he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained everything he wanted. Such is the power of hiding your intentions.\nKEYS TO P OWER\nMost people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their opinions at every opportunity, and constantly reveal their plans and intentions.\nThey do this for several reasons. First, it is easy and natural to always want\nto talk about one's feelings and plans for the future. It takes effort to control\nyour tongue and monitor what you reveal. Second, many believe that by\nbeing honest and open they are winning people's hearts and showing their\ngood nature.They are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instrument, which bloodies more than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend\npeople; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what\nthey want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or\nthink. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so\npredictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you,\nand power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions. In 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirty-five-year-old deputy in\nthe Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career. The issues of\nthe day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into\nwhich Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful\nneighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds,\neven threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in\nline to be Prussia's king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament\nrallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only\nones to oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his\nministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians.\nThroughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even passionate\nsupporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of German unification, of going to war against Austria and humiliating the country that for so\nlong had kept Germany divided. A former soldier, he saw warf are as a glorious business.\nThis, after all, was the man who years later would say, \"The great\nquestions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions, but\nby iron and blood.\"\nPassionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck nevertheless\ngave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever that astonished\nall who heard it. \"Woe unto the statesman,\" he said, \"who makes war without a reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you\nwill all look differently at these questions. Will you then have the courage\nto turn to the peasant contemplating the ashes of his farm, to the man who\nhas been crippled, to the father who has lost his children?\" Not only did\nBismarck go on to talk of the madness of this war, but, strangest of all, he\npraised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he\nhad stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against\nthe war-what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused,\nand several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his ministers won out, and war was averted.\nA few weeks after Bismarck's infamous speech, the king, grateful that  " };

For reasons-good reasons-of his own, the uncle\nhad been nursing a grudge against the millionaires for years; this was his\nchance to get back at them.

Master the art and you will always\nhave the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one's intentions is a\nsimple truth about human nature: Our first instinct is to always trust appearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and\nhear-constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else\nwould exhaust and terrify uso This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal\none's intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you\nseem to aim for, in front of people's eyes and they will take the appearance\nfor reality. Once their eyes foeus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what\nyou are really up to. In seduction, set up conflictin signal , such as desire\nand indifference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame\ntheir desire to possess you.\nA tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to\nsupport an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments.\n(Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.) Most people will\nbelieve you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to\nplay so lightly with something as emotional as one's opinions and values.\nThe same applies for any decoyed object of desire: Seem to want something in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will\nbe throWll off the scent, making all kinds of errors in their calculations.\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marlborough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort,\nbecause it proteeted a vital thoroughfare into Franee. Yet he knew that if he\ndestroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted-to advance down\nthat road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with\nsome of his troops, making it appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of\nhis OWll. The French attaeked the fort and the duke let them reeapture it.\nOnce they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had\nwanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road\nwas unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France.\nUse this tactie in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by\nclosing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals-just not yOUf\nreal ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly,\nopen, and trusting; you conceal YOUf intentions; and you send YOUf rivals\non time-consuming wild-goose ehases.\nAnother powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false sineerity. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty. Remember-their first instinet is to trust appearances, and sinee they value honesty and want to\nbelieve in the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or\nsee through YOUf aet. Seeming to believe what you say gives your words\ngreat weight. This is how Iago deceived and destroyed Othello: Given the\ndepth of his emotions, the apparent sincerity of his coneems about Desdemona's supposed infidelity, how eould Othello distrust hirn? This is also\nhow the great con artist Yellow Kid Weil pulled the wool over suckers'\neyes: Seeming to believe so deeply in the deeoyed object he was dangling " };

He knew the boxing-match scam would be the perfect ruse\nto separate Geezil from his money quickly and definitively. But he also\nknew that if he had begun by trying to interest Geezil in the boxing match,\nhe would have failed miserably. He had to conceal his intentions and\nswitch attention, create a smoke screen-in this case the sale of the lodge.\nOn the train ride and in the hotel room Geezil's mind had been completely occupied with the pending deal, the easy money, the chance to\nhobnob with wealthy men. He had failed to notice that Gross was out of\nshape and middle-aged at best. Such is the distracting power of a smoke\nscreen. Engrossed in the business deal, Geezil's attention was easily diverted to the boxing match, but only at a point when it was already too late\nfor hirn to notice the details that would have given Gross away. The match,\nafter all, now depended on a bribe rather than on the boxer's physical condition. And Geezil was so distracted at the end by the illusion of the boxer's death\nthat he completely forgot about his money.\nLearn from the Yellow Kid: The familiar, inconspicuous front is the\nperfect smoke screen. Approach your mark with an idea that seems ordinary enough-a business deal, financial intrigue. The sucker's mind is distracted, his suspicions allayed. That is when you gently guide hirn onto the\nsecond path, the slippery slope down which he slides helplessly into your\ntrap.  with whom he avidly discussed business, Weil also brought along a\ncompanion, a somewhat paunchy man named George Gross. Weil explained to Geezil that he hirnself was a boxing trainer, that Gross was one\nof the promising prizefighters he trained, and that he had asked Gross to\ncome along to make sure the fighter stayed in shape. For a promising\nfighter, Gross was unimpressive looking-he had gray hair and a beer\nbelly-but Geezil was so excited about the deal that he didn't really think\nab out the man's flabby appearance.\nOnce in Galesburg, Weil and his uncle went to fetch the financiers\nwhile Geezil waited in a hotel room with Gross, who promptly put on his\nboxing trunks. As Geezil half watched, Gross began to shadowbox. Distracted as he was, Geezil ignored how badly the boxer wheezed after a few\nminutes of exercise, although his style seemed real enough. An hour later,\nWeil and his uncle reappeared with the financiers, an impressive, intimidating group of men, all wearing fancy suits. The meeting went well and the financiers agreed to sell the lodge to Geezil, who had already had the\n$35,000 wired to a local bank.\nThis minor business now settled, the financiers sat back in their chairs\nand began to banter about high finance, throwing out the name 'j. P. Morgan\" as if they knew the man. Finally one of them noticed the boxer in the\ncorner of the room. Weil explained what he was doing there. The financier\ncountered that he too had a boxer in his entourage, whom he named. Weil\nlaughed brazenly and exclaimed that his man could easily knock out their\nman. Conversation escalated into argument. In the heat of passion, Weil\nchallenged the men to a bet. The financiers eagerly agreed and left to get\ntheir man ready for a fight the next day.\nAs soon as they had left, the uncle yelled at Weil, right in front of\nGeezil: They did not have enough money to bet with, and once the financiers discovered this, the uncle would be fired. Weil apologized for getting hirn in this mess, but he had a plan: He knew the other boxer well, and\nwith a little bribe, they could fix the fight. But where would the money\ncome from for the bet? the uncle replied. Without it they were as good as\ndead. Finally Geezil had heard enough. Unwilling to jeopardize his deal\nwith any ill will, he offered his own $35,000 cash for part of the bet. Even if\nhe lost that, he would wire for more money and still make a profit on the\nsale of the lodge. The uncle and nephew thanked hirn. With their own\n$15,000 and Geezil's 1$35,000 they would manage to have enough for the\nbet. That evening, as Geezil watched the two boxers rehearse the fix in\nthe hotel room, his mind reeled at the killing he was going to make from both\nthe boxing match and the sale of the lodge.\nThe fight took place in a gym the next day. Weil handled the cash,\nwhich was placed for security in a locked box. Everything was proceeding as planned in the hotel room. The financiers were looking glum at\nhow badly their fighter was doing, and Geezil was dreaming about the easy\nmoney he was about to make. Then, suddenly, a wild swing by the financier's fighter hit Gross hard in the face, knocking hirn down. When he\nhit the canvas, blood spurted from his mouth. He coughed, then lay still. " };

Never angry or\nimpatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles, lulling them with charm\nand obsequiousness before he attacked. In the case of Balcha, Selassie\nplayed on the man's wariness, his suspicion that the banquet was a trap-­\nwhich in fact it was, but not the one he expected. Selassie's way of allaying\nBalcha's fears-letting him bring his bodyguard to the banquet, giving hirn\ntop billing there, making him feel in control--created a thick smoke screen,\nconcealing the real action three miles away.\nRemember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive.\nWin their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their\nview in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating\nblow. A helpful or apparently honest ge sture, or one that implies the other\nperson's superiority-these are perfect diversionary devices.\nProperly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It enabled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing a single\nbullet Some hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of\nSidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a great\nwarrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy. He pointedly stayed away from the capital. Finally Selassie, in his gentle but stern\nway, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord decided to obey, but in\ndoing so he would turn the tables on this pretender to the Ethiopian\nthrone: He would come to Addis Ababa at his own speed, and with an\narmy of 10,000 men, a force large enough to defend hirnself, perhaps even\nstart a civil war. Stationing this formidable force in a valley three rniles\nfrom the capital, he waited, as a king would. Selassie would have to come\nto bim.\nSelassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an afternoon banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew history-he knew\nthat previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets as a trap.\nOnce he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have hirn arrested or\nmurdered. To signal his understanding of the situation, he agreed to come\nto the banquet, but only if he could bring his personal bodyguard-600 of\nbis best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend hirn and themselves. To\nBalcha's surprise, Selassie answered with the utmost politeness that he\nwould be honored to play host to such warriors.\nOn the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get\ndrunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace, Selassie\nwas his charrning best. He deferred to Balcha, treated hirn as if he desperately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha refused to be\ncharmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return to his camp by\nnightfall, his army had orders to attack the capital. Selassie reacted as if\nhurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came time for the traditional\nsinging of songs in honor of Ethiopia's leaders, he made a point of allowing\nonly songs honoring the warlord of Sidamo. It seemed to Balcha that Selassie was scared, intimidated by this great warrior who could not be outwitted. Sensing the change, Balcha believed that he would be the one to\ncall the shots in the days to come.\nAt the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their march\nback to camp arnidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to the capital\nover his shoulder, he planned his strategy-how his own soldiers would\nmarch through the capital in triumph within weeks, and Selassie would be\nput in his place, his place being either prison or death. When Balcha came\nin sight of bis camp, however, he saw that something was terribly wrong.\nWhere before there had been colorful tents stretching as far as the eye\ncould see, now there was nothing, only smoke from doused fires.

A few months later, though, Gould\nwas it at again, complaining he had been treated unfairly. He started up a\nsecond company to compete with Western Union and its new acquisition.\nThe same thing happened again: Western Union bought hirn out to shut\nhirn up. Soon the pattern began for the third time, but now Gould went for\nthe jugular: He suddenly staged a bloody takeover struggle and managed\nto gain complete control of Western Union. He had established a pattern\nthat had tricked the company's directors into thinking his goal was to be\nbought out at a handsome rate. Once they paid hirn off, they relaxed and\nfailed to notice that he was actually playing for higher stakes. The pattern is\npowerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the opposite of\nwhat you are really doing.\nAnother psychological weakness on which to construct a smoke screen\nis the tendency to mistake appearances for reality-the feeling that if someone seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be real. This habit\nmakes the seamless blend a very effective front. The trick is simple: You simply blend in with those around you. The better you blend, the less suspicious you become. During the Cold War of the 1950s and '60s, as is now\nnotorious, a slew of British civil servants passed secrets to the Soviets. They\nwent undetected for years because they were apparently decent chaps, had\ngone to all the right schools, and fit the old-boy network perfectly. Blending in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the better you can conceal your intentions.\nRemember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors,\nto put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not despair at having to wear\nsuch a bland mask-it is often your unreadability that draws people to you\nand makes you appear a person of power.  Once you have lulled your suckers' attention with the familiar, they\nwill not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs. This\nderives from a simple truth: people can only focus on one thing at a time. It\nis really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless person they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up something else. The\ngrayer and more uniform the smoke in your smoke screen, the better it\nconceals your intentions. In the decoy and red herring devices discussed in\nPart I, you actively distract people; in the smoke screen, you lull your victims, drawing them into your web. Because it is so hypnotic, this is often\nthe best way of concealing your intentions.\nThe simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind a bland,\nunreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection.\nThis is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to perfect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelt's face. Baron\nJames Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts behind bland smiles and nondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand,\n\"Never was a face less of a barometer.\" Henry Kissinger would bore his opponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice,\nhis blank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed\nover, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught offguard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains it,\n\"While playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he\npractices a bland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and\nconfuses opponents, permits greater concentration.\"\nAn adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be practiced on a number of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of distraction and\nmisdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens is the noble gesture.\nPeople want to believe apparently noble gestures are genuine, for the belief\nis pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive these gestures can be.\nThe art dealer Joseph Duveen was once confronted with a terrible problem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen's paintings were\nrunning out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes getting ever higher, it\nseemed unlikely that they would keep buying. The solution was the National\nGallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which Duveen helped create in 1937 by\ngetting Andrew Mellon to donate his collection to it. The National Gallery\nwas the perfect front for Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes,\ncleared wall space for new purchases, and reduced the number of paintings\non the market, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this\nwhile the donors created the appearance of being public benefactors.\nAnother effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a series of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the\nsame way. The pattern plays on the psychology of anticipation: Our behavior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think.\nIn 1878 the American robber baronJay Gould created a company that\nbegan to threaten the monopoly of the telegraph company Western Union.\nThe directors of Western Union decided to buy Gould's company" };

He stood for election to the high rank of consul. Candidates for this position traditionally made a public address early in the race,\nand when Coriolanus came before the people, he began by displaying the\ndozens of scars he had accumulated over seventeen years of fighting for\nRome. Few in the crowd really heard the lengthy speech that followed;\nthose scars, proof of his valor and patriotism, moved the people to tears.\nCoriolanus's election seemed certain.\nWhen the polling day arrived, however, Coriolanus made an entry\ninto the forum escorted by the entire senate and by the city's patricians, the\naristocracy. The common people who saw this were disturbed by such a\nblustering show of confidence on election day.\nAnd then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressing the wealthy citizens who had accompanied him. His words were arrogant and insolent.\nClaiming certain victory in the vote, he boasted of his battlefield exploits,\nmade sour jokes that appealed only to the patricians, voiced angry accusations against his opponents, and speculated on the riches he would bring to\nRome. This time the people listened: They had not realized that this legendary soldier was also a common braggart.\nNews of Coriolanus's second speech spread quickly through Rome,\nand the people turned out in great numbers to make sure he was not\nelected. Defeated, Coriolanus returned to the battlefield, bitter and vowing\nrevenge on the common folk who had voted against him. Same weeks later\na large shipment of grain arrived in Rome. The senate was ready to distribute this food to the people, for free, but just as they were preparing to vote\non the question Coriolanus appeared on the scene and took the senate\nfloor. The distribution, he argued, would have a harmful effect on the city\nas a whole. Several senators appeared won over, and the vote on the distribution fell into doubt. Coriolanus did not stop there: He went on to condemn the concept of democracy itself. He advocated getting rid of the\npeople's representatives-the tribunes-and turning over the governing of\nthe city to the patricians.\nWhen word of Coriolanus's latest speech reached the people, their\nanger knew no bounds. The tribunes were sent to the senate to demand\nthat Coriolanus appear before them. He refused. Riots broke out all over\nthe city. The senate, fearing the people's wrath, finally voted in favor of the\ngrain distribution. The tribunes were appeased, but the people still demanded that Coriolanus speak to them and apologize.

Barnum, trying to establish his reputation as America's premier showman, decided to purchase the American Museum in\nManhattan and turn it into a collection of curiosities that would secure his\nfarne. The problem was that he had no money. The museum's asking price\nwas $15,000, but Barnum was able to put together a proposal that appealed\nto the institution's owners even though it replaced cash up front with\ndozens of guarantees and references. The owners came to a verbal agreement with Barnum, but at the last minute, the principal partner changed\nhis mind, and the museum and its collection were sold to the directors of\nPeale's Museum. Barnum was infuriated, but the partner explained that\nbusiness was business-the museum had been sold to Peale's because\nPeale's had a reputation and Barnum had none.\nBarnum immediately decided that if he had no reputation to bank on,\nhis only recourse was to ruin the reputation of Peale's. Accordingly he\nlaunched a letter-writing campaign in the newspapers, calling the owners a\nbunch of \"broken-down bank directors\" who had no idea how to run a museum or entertain people. He warned the public against buying Peale's\nstock, since the business's purchase of another museum would invariably\nspread its resources thin. The campaign was effective, the stock plummeted, and with no more confidence in Peale's track record and reputation, the owners of the American Museum reneged on their deal and sold\nthe whole thing to Barnum.\nIt took years for Peale's to recover, and they never forgot what Barnum had done. Mr. Peale hirnself decided to attack Barnum by building a\nreputation for \"high-brow entertainment,\" promoting his museum's programs as more scientific than those of his vulgar competitor. Mesmerism\n(hypnotism) was one of Peale's \"scientific\" attractions, and for a while it\ndrew big crowds and was quite successful.  Chuko Liang was commonly known as the \"Sleeping Dragon.\" His exploits in the War of the Three Kingdoms were legendary. Once a man\ndaiming to be a disaffected enemy lieutenant came to his camp, offering\nhelp and information. Liang instantly recognized the situation as a setup;\nthis man was a false deserter, and should be beheaded. At the last minute,\nthough, as the ax was about to fall, Liang stopped the execution and offered to spare the man's life if he agreed to become a double agent. Grateful and terrified, the man agreed, and began supplying false information to\nthe enemy. Liang won battle after battle.\nOn another occasion Liang stole a military seal and created false documents dispatching his enemy's troops to distant locations. Once the troops\nhad dispersed, he was able to capture three eities, so that he controlled an\nentire corridor of the enemy's kingdom. He also once tricked the enemy\ninto believing one of its best generals was a traitor, forcing the man to escape and join forces with Liang. The Sleeping Dragon carefully cultivated\nhis reputation of being the deverest man in China, one who always had a\ntrick up his sleeve. As powerful- as any weapon, this reputation struck fear\ninto his enemy.\nSima Yi had fought against Chuko Liang dozens of times and knew\nhirn weIl. When he came on the empty city, with Liang praying on the\nwall, he was stunned. The Taoist robes, the chanting, the incense--this had\nto be a game of intimidation. The man was obviously taunting hirn, daring\nhirn to walk into a trap. The game was so obvious that for one moment it\ncrossed Yi's mind that Liang actually was alone, and desperate. B YOUf short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and\nthey will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments\nthat will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses.\nThey will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and\nthey will go horne and ponder YOUf every word. This extra attention to\nYOUf brief comments will only add to your power.\nSaying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In most\nareas of life, the less you say, the more profound and mysterious you appear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it was\ngenerally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do by\ntalking to them. They would turn against you, subvert YOUf wishes, disobey\nyou out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend, \"I leamed that you actually have more power when you shut up.\"\nIn his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success. His\ninterviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say something\nvague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in circles trying to\nfigure it out, imagining there was something prafound behind his often\nmeaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked ab out his work; he let others do\nthe interpreting. He claimed to have leamed this technique from that master of enigma Marcel Duchamp, another twentieth-century artist who realized early on that the less he said about his work, the more people talked\nabout it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became.\nBy saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning\nand power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something\nfoolish, even dangeraus. In 1825 a new czar, Nicholas I, ascended the\nthrone of Russia. A rebellion immediately broke out, led by liberals demanding that the country modernize-that its industries and civil structures catch up with the rest of Europe. Brutally crushing this rebellion (the\nDecembrist Uprising), Nicholas I sentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty\nRyleyev, to death. On the day of the execution Ryleyev stood on the gallows, the noose around his neck. The trapdoor opened-but as Ryleyev\ndangled, the rape brake, dashing hirn to the ground. At the time, events\nlike this were considered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man\nsaved from execution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his\nfeet, bruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called\nout to the crowd, \"You see, in Russia they don't know how to do anything\nproperly, not even how to make rape!\"\nA messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of the\nfailed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas I nevertheless began to sign the pardon. But then: \"Did Ryleyev say anything after\nthis miracle?\" the czar asked the messenger. \"Sire,\" the messenger replied,\n\"he said that in Russia they don't even know how to make rope.\"\n\"In that case,\" said the Czar, \"let us prove the contrary,\" and he tore\nup the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time the\nrope did not break. " };

This\nsingle quality--efficiency, say, or seductiveness-becomes a kind of calling\ncard that announces your presence and places others under a speIl. A reputation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception.\nCasanova used bis reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his future conquests; women who had heard of his powers became immensely\ncurious, and wanted to discover for themselves what had made hirn so romantically successful.\nPerhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are prevented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate\nwith someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name\nto whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputation for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. When\nP. T. Barnum wanted to dean up a reputation for promoting vulgar entertainment, he brought the singer Jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a\nstellar, high-dass reputation, and the American tour Bamum sponsored for\nher greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of\nnineteenth-century America were long unable to rid themselves of a reputation for cruelty and mean-spiritedness. Only when they began collecting\nart, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently associated\nwith those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften their unpleasant image.\nReputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Especially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, anticipating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or\ndefensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies-that reveals insecurity, not confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and\nnever appear desperate in your self-defense. On the other hand, an attack\non another man's reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you\nhave less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle,\nand your own thus-far-small reputation gives hirn a small target when he\ntries to return your fire. Bamum used such campaigns to great effect in his\nearly career. But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem\nto engage in petty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy's reputation\ndeverly, you will inadvertently ruin your own.\nThomas Edison, considered the inventor who hamessed electricity,\nbelieved that a workable system would have to be based on direct current (DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared to have succeeded in creating a system based on alternating current (AC), Edison was\nfurious. He determined to ruin Tesla's reputation, by making the public believe that the AC system was inherently unsafe, and Tesla irresponsible in\npromoting it.  This is the reason for the supreme importance of making and maintaining a reputation that is of your own creation.\nThat reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appearances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you are\nreally like, and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges\nyou-a powerful position to be in. Reputation has a power like magic:\nWith one stroke of its wand, it can double your strength. It can also send\npeople scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear\nbrilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the reputation of the doer.\nIn the aneient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man\nnamed Mi Tzu-hsia who had a reputation for supreme eivility and graeiousness. He became the mler's favorite. It was a law in Wei that \"whoever\nrides secretly in the mler's coach shall have his feet cut off,\" but when Mi\nTzu-hsia's mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit her, pretending\nthat the mler had given hirn permission. When the mler found out, he said,\n\"How dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother's sake he even forgot that he\nwas committing a crime making hirn liable to lose his feet!\"\nAnother time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-hsia\nbegan eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the mler the\nother half to eat. The mler remarked, \"You love me so much that you would\neven forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest of the peach!\"\nLater, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi Tzuhsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging his reputation; the mler came to see his actions in a new light. \"This fellow once rode\nin my coach under pretense of my order,\" he told the courtiers angrily,\n\"and another time he gave me a half-eaten peach.\" For the same actions\nthat had charmed the mler when he was the favorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had\nto suffer the penalties. The fate of his feet depended solely on the strength\nof his reputation.\nIn the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one outstanding quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality\nsets you apart and gets other people to talk ab out you. You then make your\nreputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care\nto build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like\nwildfire.\nA solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your\nstrengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create an\naura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in the\nNorth African desert during World War II, the German general Erwin\nRommel had a reputation for cunning and for deceptive maneuvering that\nstruck terror into everyone who faced hirn. Even when his forces were depleted, and when British tanks outnumbered his by five to one, entire eities\nwould be evacuated at the news of his approach.\nAs they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires\nrespect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene,\nor utter a single word.
